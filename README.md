## Credit & Reference

This project is inspired by [Programmer Zaman Now](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProgrammerZamanNow)'s Express.js + React.js tutorial.

I rebuilt the backend using NestJS and plan to use NextJS for the frontend, following the same structure and features for learning purposes and architectural improvements.
